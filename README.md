# Gemma

Today, navigation is easier than ever before. Apps like Google and Apple Maps locate users, find destinations, and plot routes in a flash. They can even “drop pins” to save locations for later visits. But there’s one catch: all these places must be on (or near) the beaten path. GPS apps know streets and buildings just fine. When it comes to the outdoors, though—places to hike, kayak, picnic, or even sit and birdwatch—these business-focused apps come up empty. Getting away from it all is just as hard as ever!

That’s why we’re building Gemma. Gemma is a geolocator app designed for “trail territory”: natural spaces that aren’t marked by roads. Users can save their current location, or other coordinates, as “pins.” They can also tag or add notes to pins as they desire. Gemma saves collections of pins as "boards," allowing users to view others' public boards or their own private ones. With Gemma as a resource, young digital natives are empowered to join in outdoor adventures. Scenic walks, bike paths, unofficial skate parks... the possibilities are as endless as your exploring. Where will *you* go with Gemma?

### Meet the team:

***Becca***
- Bio: Hey I'm becca! I'm a computer science major with math and psych minors. I spend most of my free time diving on calvin's swim and dive team so catch me at the pool!

***Oscar***
- Bio: Driven by passion, and danger. Physics and CS double major, but mostly a complete dork. I will do whatever is necessary to reach my goals, even lift a car (did that one time). The problem is that my goals don't always align with what's actually important; for example: spending a semester developing electromyography circuits for muscle-to-servo control, while I really should have been in class (it WAS pretty sweet tho).

***Eleanor***
- Bio: Yo yo! I'm a Writing and CS+Linguistics double major. I was born in Boston, MA, but I grew up in Charleston, SC. I love chocolate and running, and I need coffee to function. If I'm not in class, I'm probably wrangling data, cooking, vacuuming, or doing other "housewife things."

***Bobae***
- Bio: My name is Bobae Grace Jung, but my legal name is Ye Eun Jung. I was born and raised in Guatemala, 
went to college in Florida for a year and transferred to Calvin U. my second year. I will be graduating 
on May 2022 with a B.S. in Computer Science with a Business minor. I am a coffee junkie, and dog-lover.
I will be the most people-person computer scientist you will ever meet <3

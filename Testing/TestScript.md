# Usability Test: **Gemma**
Fall 2021
Team D -- Furious Five

#### Introduction:
Hi! Thanks so much for agreeing to test Gemma, our outdoor geolocation app. Our team would like to observe real users’ first impressions of Gemma. Your reactions will show us how our program can better meet your needs. 

Today, we’ll walk you through some basic usability tests. These tests ask you to perform simple actions using our app. Please know—if you get stuck on a test and can’t figure it out, that’s not your fault. It’s ours! We're testing Gemma's ability to figure *you* out, not the other way around. 

During the usability tests, we ask that you think out loud. Tell us your thought process as you decide what to click and why. Please feel free to ask us questions at any time. And if you ever want to stop testing, for any reason, just say the word. 


#### Background Questions:
Gemma was designed to encourage the outdoorsperson in all of us. Do you enjoy spending time outside? If so, what do you like to do? 

What are some barriers that have kept you from doing those things? 

Before we begin, do you have any questions for us? 

Sweet! As a final reminder, we ask that you narrate your thoughts while you engage with these tasks. 


#### The Test:
1. Home screen – Here is Gemma’s opening screen. Try to log in using the account
**blw22@students.calvin.edu** **GemmaDemo0**

2. The app is designed to work across the Beltline in Calvin’s nature preserve. There, users can save sites in nature that they’d like to visit or remember. 
* Can you add a pin to the map screen? Make sure to add a title, a tag, and something in the notes.
* Can you find your pin and the information about it? 
* Now can you delete that pin? 

3. Gemma also allows users to save pins in collections called “boards.” 
* Can you find the board called “Private Board”? 
* Now can you find that board using the search bar? 
* Can you delete that board from the list? (For now, it is only a button, no functionality.) 
* Now can you find the public boards and open the board called “Campus!” 
* Can you find the pin called “The best dining hall” using the search bar? 
* Now can you add a new board with the campus map on it? 

4. Can you find your user information? 

5. Can you logout? 

Cool! That will be all.


#### Thanks:
Thank you so much for helping us test Gemma! You’re the most important part of this endeavor, and we really appreciate your time. 

We’ll contact you soon to share what we found during these tests, and how we’re changing Gemma to reflect our discoveries. Anything you did or said here will be kept private. 

At this time, you are free to go. If you have any specific feedback you’d like to give us, you’re welcome to do that as well. Thanks, and have a great rest of your day!

#Vision Statement: Gemma

Today, navigation is easier than ever before. Apps like Google and Apple Maps locate users, find destinations, and plot routes in a flash. 
They can even "drop pins" to save locations for later visits. But there's one catch: all these places must be on (or near) the beaten path.
GPS apps know streets and buildings just fine. When it comes to the outdoors, though -- places to hike, kayak, picnic, or just sit and 
birdwatch -- these business-focused apps come up empty.

That's why we're building Gemma. Gemma is a geolocator app designed for "trail territory": natural spaces that aren't marked by roads. Users
can save their current location, or other coordinates, as "pins." They can also add notes and pictures to pins as they desire. Gemma allows
users to toggle between public pins (the area's most popular/upvoted locations) or their own private ones. With Gemma as a resource, young
digital natives are empowered to join the outdoor adventure. Scenic walks, bike paths, unofficial skate parks... the possibilities are as
endless as your exploring. Where will _you_ go with Gemma?
